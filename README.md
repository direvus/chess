*HOW ABOUT A NICE GAME OF CHESS?  -- WOPR*

This is a chess library and interactive chessboard web application written
using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev).

This is **not** a program that plays chess.  It is a program that enables
humans to play chess.

## Features

The application supports:

- The full set of chess move logic.
- Import and export using Portable Game Notation (PGN).
- Move history and time travel.
- Automatically detect checkmate and stalemate.
- Board rotation.
- Game tags.
- Move annotations (import/export only).

## Absent features

The application currently does not support:

- Online multiplayer ... yet!
- Game clock / move timing.
- Import/export in formats other than PGN.
